A short FM soundscape, using the Maximilian C++ library for some frequency modulation synthesis.

This project can be launched from the command line by cd'ing into the directory and entering "./run.sh" (the shellscript works for Mac but not Windows).

The project is just in Maximilian, not Open Frameworks.
